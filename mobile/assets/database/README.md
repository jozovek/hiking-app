# Database Directory

This directory will contain the SQLite database file for the Philadelphia Hiking Trails app.

## trails.db

The `trails.db` file will be generated from the processed trail data and will contain the following tables:

1. `trails` - Information about hiking trails
2. `parks` - Information about parks
3. `pois` - Points of interest along trails

The database file will be bundled with the app to enable offline functionality.

## Database Generation

The database is generated by the data processing pipeline in the `data` directory of the main project. The pipeline:

1. Collects trail data from OpenStreetMap
2. Reconstructs complete trails from fragmented data
3. Creates a structured SQLite database with spatial indexing
4. Validates the data quality

Once the database is generated, it should be placed in this directory for the app to access it.
